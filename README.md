I work on a variety of things, both for work and for my own interest.  I especially enjoy collaborating with others to create cool new things.

_NOTE: if you see "Unverified" next to my commits, that's because they're signed with my [SSH key](https://github.com/djmitche.keys), and GitHub [does not yet support SSH signatures](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/7744)._
